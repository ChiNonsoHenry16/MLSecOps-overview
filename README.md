# MLSecOps: A Modern Guide to Machine Learning Security Operations

As organizations increasingly deploy machine learning (ML) and generative AI (GenAI) solutions [1], a critical gap is emerging in securing the ML lifecycle‚Äîand it's called MLSecOps. Infact, one may say that MLSecOps is a security frontier in this age of AI. 

## üìç What is MLSecOps?

Machine Learning Security Operations (MLSecOps) is an emerging discipline that embeds security, governance, and threat mitigation into the full AI/ML lifecycle‚Äîfrom data collection and model training to deployment, monitoring, and incident response. It extends DevSecOps practices to ML pipelines, addressing unique threats like data poisoning, model theft, prompt injection, and AI supply chain attacks [2]. The diagram below shows specific security practices to be included in the MLOps pipeline [3].

## Shocking Reality: Developers Often Bypass MLSecOps

*	A Snyk survey of 537 developers and security professionals found:
      - ‚Äú96% use AI tools in development and nearly 80% bypass organizational security policies to use them‚Äù. 
      - ‚ÄúOnly 9.7% automate more than 75% of their security scans despite high AI usage‚Äú[4].
*	In an IDC/TechTarget generative AI study of 200 U.S. developers:
      - ‚Äú40% say they ‚Äúoften‚Äù (31.8%) or ‚Äúalways‚Äù (10.3%) discover vulnerabilities in AI-generated code‚Äù [5]. 
*	‚ÄúOnly 18% have implemented continuous monitoring with KPIs‚Äù [6].
*	‚Äú93% of organizations are using AI but only 7% have fully embedded governance frameworks‚Äù [6]
*	‚Äú30% of all AI cyberattacks will leverage training-data poisoning, AI model theft, or adversarial samples to attack AI-powered systems.‚Äù ‚Äì Gartner [7]
*	‚Äú25 out of 28 organizations struggle to find the right tools to secure their ML systems.‚Äù ‚Äì Microsoft Survey [8]

These stats reflect a major security risk: high adoption, low compliance. More so, these gaps can lead to adversarial AI/ML (data poisoning, model inversion, prompt injection), and unauthorized model access [8].


## ‚öôÔ∏è The 5 Domains of MLSecOps

To safeguard ML systems across the lifecycle, MLSecOps addresses five key risk areas [10]:

1. **Supply Chain Vulnerability** - ML models are composed of datasets, code, and components‚Äîeach introducing security risks. Like software supply chains, they're vulnerable to data poisoning, model theft, and denial-of-service attacks. Model scanners, threat feeds, and AI-specific security tools are essential.
2. **Model Provenance** ‚Äì Trust in AI starts with traceability. MLSecOps promotes transparency through practices like maintaining a Machine Learning Bill of Materials (MLBOM), enabling organizations to track model lineage and changes from training to deployment.
3. **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)** ‚Äì With regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and the EU AI Act, ML systems must meet strict compliance standards. MLSecOps provides frameworks to monitor data location, test models for bias and reliability, and ensure lawful AI usage.
4. **Trusted AI: Fair, Explainable, Unbiased** ‚Äì Responsible AI is transparent and equitable. MLSecOps ensures explainability and fairness by connecting ethics, bias detection, and model documentation, helping avoid discriminatory or opaque decision-making.
5. **Adversarial ML Defense** ‚Äì Models are increasingly targeted by adversarial attacks. MLSecOps implements strategies like adversarial training, threat detection, and robust classifier design to secure models in real-time.


## ‚öôÔ∏è MLSecOps Implementation ‚Äì Key Insights

The following are key insights required for the implementation of MLSecOps in your organization [11]. 
1. Understanding Risks and Regulations ‚Äì Identifying AI/ML security needs (i.e., data sources, infrastructure, risk/threat evaluation, defining clear objectives).
2. Build a Team ‚Äì The team is made up of data scientists, ML engineers and security experts. Then, establish comprehensive policies, procedures, documentation and communication guidelines. 
3. Tailor MLSecOps to Your Organization - Use the five MLSecOps domains above to design a security approach aligned with your organizational needs. 
4. Build Security into the ML Development Lifecycle ‚Äì Include secure coding and threat modeling, adversarial scenario testing, red-teaming, and monitoring as well as CI/CD triggers. 
5. Make MLSecOps a Continuous Process with Training & Audit ‚Äì Treat MLSecOps not as a one-off project, but as a continuous program. 



## üöÄ Benefits

- Enables compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, AI Act)
- Early detection of vulnerabilities (e.g., prompt injection, data leakage)
- Ensures AI systems remain trusted, transparent, and safe
- Aligns AI deployments with Zero Trust and regulatory frameworks
- Prevents model misuse and drift
- Builds public confidence and internal resilience

Tools like Protect AI's NB Defense, Microsoft Purview, Netskope SaaS Secure Posture Management, and MLSecOps scanner integrations (e.g., Open-Source Guardian) are already helping secure ML pipelines.

Let's not treat ML security as an afterthought. Integrate it early. Make it continuous, to ensure security of AI/ML models and systems.
